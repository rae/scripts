# scripts
Various scripts (bash, zsh, perl, python, etc) I created and use day-to-day
* aaccheck
   - checks `mkv` files to see if they have 'aac' audio (so you can play them in VLC)
* clm
  - columnize input
* ffaudio
   - see what audio tracks there are in an `mkv` file
* toaac
   - convert ac3 audio tracks to aac and add the resulting aac as an *additional* track to the tracks from
     the original file, resulting in a new file with all original tracks *plus* a new `aac` audio track
